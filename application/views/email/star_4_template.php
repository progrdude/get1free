<h1>Dear Customer!</h1>

<p>
	Thank you for your review! We really appreciate your experience and would like to ask you to change your review to 5 stars and send you 10$ to say thank you for the cooperation!ðŸ’¸
</p>
<p>
	We know how it sounds but, unfortunately, since 94% of consumers say that even a 4 star review convinces them to avoid a business, we ask for the upgrade sometimes. We just don't want our product to not even been tried because of low rating ðŸ˜ž  We'd also really love to help you with the problem you had to face, so if you let us know what went wrong by replying directly to this mail, we'd happily make your customer experience a lot better, since we guarantee 100% customer satisfaction!
